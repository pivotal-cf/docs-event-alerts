This topic describes how to monitor and troubleshoot Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Event Alerts.

##<a id='monitor'></a> Monitor PCF Event Alerts

PCF Event Alerts is deployed as an app in PCF. By default, this app is called `event-alerts` and is deployed in the `event-alerts` space within the `system` org.

To monitor the performance of PCF Event Alerts or to retrieve troubleshooting information, you can do one or more of the following:

* Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to obtain logs for the `event-alerts` app.
  For more information, see [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html). 
* Use the PCF Metrics service.
  For more information, see [PCF Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-metrics/index.html).
* Use the Metrics Forwarder for PCF service.
  The `event-alerts` app detects if you have an available instance of Metrics Forwarder for PCF
  and transmits custom app metrics through Loggregator to the service.
  For more information, see [Metrics Forwarder for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/metrics-forwarder/).  
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When Metrics Forwarder is not installed,
     Event Alerts produces an error.
     This indicates that no custom metrics are being published to the Firehose.
     It does not indicate a problem with the system.</p>

##<a id="scale"></a> Scale PCF Event Alerts

You might need to scale PCF Event Alerts to improve performance.

To scale PCF Event Alerts, perform the following steps:

1. Use the cf CLI to log in to your PCF deployment as an admin. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf login
	API endpoint: http<span>s:</span>//api.sys.cf-example.com
	Email> admin
	Password>
	</pre>
1. When prompted, select the `system` org and the `event-alerts` space.
1. Scale up the number of instances of the `event-alerts` app.
   Two instances should adequately handle most alerting workloads from PCF Healthwatch.
   For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf scale event-alerts -i 2</pre>
	If you are running very large PCF deployments with frequent threshold events,
        you might need to increase the instance count above two. 

##<a id="reduce-notifications"></a> Reduce Notifications

If PCF Event Alerts is receiving frequent event notifications, you can do one or both of the following:

* Unsubscribe from alerts that have minimal action.
* Increase threshold values to supply better indicators for action.

For more information about unsubscribing from alerts and increasing threshold values, see [Using PCF Event Alerts](using.html). 

##<a id="t-shoot-errors"></a> Troubleshooting Errors

This section provides information on how to troubleshooting specific errors or error messages.

###<a id="errand"></a> Deploy PCF Event Alerts Errand Fails

This problem happens when you do not have `SUPER` privileges and binary logging is enabled.
If you do not resolve this issue, PCF Event Alerts is not deployed.

####Symptom

When you **Apply Changes**, you see in the Ops Manager installation pane that the **Deploy PCF Event Alerts** errand fails with the following error:

```
You do not have the SUPER privilege and 
binary logging is enabled (you *might* want to use the less safe
log_bin_trust_function_creators variable)
```

####Explanation

For information about the above error message, 
see [Stored Program Binary Logging](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/stored-programs-logging.html) 
in the open source MySQL documentation. 

####Solution
To solve this issue, do the following:

  1. Drop the PCF Event Alerts database and recreate it. For information about dropping a database, see [DROP DATABASE Syntax](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/drop-database.html) in the open source MySQL documentation.
  2. Do one of the following:
     * In the database, disable binary logging. For information about disabling binary logging, see [The Binary Log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/binary-log.html) in the open source MySQL documentation. 
     * In the database, set `log_bin_trust_function_creators` to `1`. For information about `log_bin_trust_function_creators`, see [log\_bin\_trust\_function\_creators](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators) in the open source MySQL documentation. 
  3. In Ops Manager, **Apply Changes** with the **Deploy PCF Event Alerts** errand checked.
