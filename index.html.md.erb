This documentation describes Pivotal Event Alerts.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

As a Pivotal Platform admin, you may want to receive notifications about important events that occur on your system.
The Pivotal Event Alerts service gives you the option to set up alerts for a variety of events.
You can use this service to subscribe to notification topics---notable events that might occur.
Notification topics are monitored by publishers---Pivotal components that emit events.
You can send these notifications using email, Slack, or webhook integration.

For example, you can subscribe to a topic from [Pivotal Healthwatch](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html)
that sends a notification when the memory use on a specific VM reaches a certain percentage.

Pivotal Platform users with admin permissions can run event alert commands and subscribe to alerts.
Admins can configure event alerts using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool.
